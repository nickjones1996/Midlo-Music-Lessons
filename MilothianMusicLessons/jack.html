      <br><br>
      <p>I've been teaching lessons since 1987 as one of my primary career activities.
        I have my music degree (1991 VCU) and many years of experience as a professional
        performer and competition winning classical artist (winner Va auditions
        MTNA/Wurlitzer 88,89 and 91 NFMC VA auditions 1990)since 1986. </p><p>My training

        is in the classical and jazz fields, but I am very familiar with popular styles,
         and try to incorporate a certain number of songs the students ask for into a
         standard musical curriculum with my lessons. I do not teach children or teens
         to play without reading music, nor do I use a rote tab or chordal or song by song
          approach because I consider both to be limiting and short sighted. I will teach adults
          to play without reading music, but I still strongly recommend learning to read music
           on the instrument -- especially if the adult has prior musical training.

      <h1 class="underlined">About my lessons</h1>
      <br><br>
      <p>My background as a performer is diverse and draws on extensive training as both a classical and solo jazz guitarist.

As a teacher my greatest strength is an ability to adapt a traditional sight-reading/theory/ ear training approach
to any style of playing. This creates a well rounded and trained player with permanent skills, regardless of whether
they study classical, jazz or popular styles.

I teach primarily evenings Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday beginning at 3:00pm and ending at 7:30pm.
  <br>I also have a day schedule on Mondays and Tuesdays from 10:30 am until 2:00pm. I will do one hour group lessons
   (min. 5 students) during the day or after 7:30 in the evenings. There is no contract for my private lessons,
   but I do require a month to month commitment.</p> <p>Twice every year I set up a student recital for my students to learn how to perform in front of an audience. They happen in December and July, and I do not charge for participation in them. However, I do take the week between Christmas and New Year's Day off and I do not pro-rate this out of the fees for recital participants. I began these recitals to help students get past the nervous barriers to good performance that many people face, and they are generally very enjoyable - a very low key way to step into public performance.

      <h1 class="underlined">Focus on: Permanent Skills</h1>
      <p>The ultimate goal sought by most people who take lessons is to establish a permanent set of playing skills to have for a lifetime. A player does not develop an understanding of music and adaptability when they simply play tabbed out song after song - an approach one finds all too often in the "music store lesson" method. All this establishes is the ability to play a few songs that will soon be out of fashion (and which were probably free on the internet anyway)
The tricky part is knowing how to engage the student with musical material they want to play while not neglecting essential aspects of music education.</p>

      <h1 class="underlined">Scheduling</h1>
      <p>I teach primarily evenings at Midlothian Music Lessons www.midlomusiclessons.com , located at 11512 Allecingie Parkway, Suite "B" (Mon., Tues., Wed. and Thurs) beginning at 3:00pm and ending at 7:30pm. I also have a day schedule on Mondays and Tuesdays from 10:30 am until 2:00pm. I will do one hour group lessons (min. 5 students) during the day or after 7:30 in the evenings. There is no contract for my private lessons, but I do require a month to month commitment. Lesson rates are as follows:
</p> <p>Lesson fees are paid in advance on the last lesson of the previous month (or the first lesson of the month for new students). I use several different method books - depending upon you or your child's age, level of previous training and/or musical interests I will try to match up something that fits with the listening interests of the student. I accept students as young as five, and if your child is ten or under you should know that I ask parents to sit in on lessons AND to be a part of the child's practice routine. After twelve kids rarely tolerate much parental involvement, but I even suggest it well into the teens -- kids usually have limited ability to schedule their time efficiently or pick an appropriate daily practice time and you will be paying for lessons that will be ineffective if they do not establish a regular practice routine.

      <h1 class="underlined">Policies</h1>
<p>If I have to miss a lesson for any reason I will let you know as far in advance
  as possible and either refund it or pro-rate it out of the next month's lesson fee.
   I do not pro-rate months for student absence. It is very important to pick a lesson
   time that you are sure you can make consistently because I do not hold myself obligated
   to make-up lessons missed by the student - particularly if there is no notice
   or very short notice of the absence.</p><p> That said, I can usually schedule make-up
   lessons in available time spots, but I will not shuffle other students around
   to accommodate a make-up. It is up to the student/parent to contact me and
   arrange to be there at the alternate time if one is available. In the event
   of snow students can assume that I will not be teaching if the Chesterfield Co.
    schools are closed. Further, if the roads become nasty and there is any
    question of safety no one should try to make it into the lesson. ALL lessons
     missed for inclement weather will either be made up or pro-rated out of the
      next month's fee at the rate of $22 per missed lesson. I don't want anyone
       on the roads if there is any concern at all.
